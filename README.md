## Hi there üëã

I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at [Harvard University](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/profile/danni-wu/)<img src='./Harvard-Logo.png' style='width: 4em;'>. I have completed my Ph.D. at [New York University, Division of Biostatistics](https://med.nyu.edu/departments-institutes/population-health/divisions-sections-centers/biostatistics/) <img src='./NYU_logo.png' style='width: 4em;'>, advised by [Eva Petkova](https://med.nyu.edu/faculty/eva-petkova), [Keith Goldfeld](https://med.nyu.edu/faculty/keith-s-goldfeld), and [Hyung Park](https://med.nyu.edu/faculty/hyung-g-park). 

I earned my M.S. in Biostatistics and Data Science from [Cornell University, Weill Cornell Medicine](https://gradschool.weill.cornell.edu/biostatistics-and-data-science), under the guidance of [Samprit Banerjee](https://gradschool.weill.cornell.edu/faculty/samprit-banerjee). Prior to that, I obtained a B.S. in Applied Statistics from the [Central University of Finance and Economics](https://en.cufe.edu.cn/) (‰∏≠Â§ÆË¥¢ÁªèÂ§ßÂ≠¶), where I was advised by [Feng Li (Êùé‰∏∞)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IN2QMXYAAAAJ&hl=en).

I interned at Moderna <img src='./Moderna-Logo.jpg' style='width: 4em;'> in 2023 summer, focused on designing a Bayesian seamless Phase II/III trial and evaluating early/surrogate endpoints to make early program decisions for their [individualized neoantigen therapies](https://www.modernatx.com/media-center/all-media/blogs/individual.neoantigen-therapies). 

My research interests include Bayesian Statistics, Precision Medicine, Clinical Trial Design, and Statistical Computing. I have been published in journals such as [JAMA Internal Medicine](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2787090), [JAMA Network Open](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/article-abstract/2788377), [BMC Medical Research Methodology](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12874-022-01813-4) and [Statistics in Medicine](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/article-abstract/2788377).
