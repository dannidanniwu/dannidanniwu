## Hi there 👋

I am Ph.D. candidate at [New York University, Division of Biostatistics](https://med.nyu.edu/departments-institutes/population-health/divisions-sections-centers/biostatistics/) <img src='./NYU_logo.png' style='width: 4em;'>, advised by [Keith Goldfeld](https://med.nyu.edu/faculty/keith-s-goldfeld), [Hyung Park](https://med.nyu.edu/faculty/hyung-g-park) and [Eva Petkova](https://med.nyu.edu/faculty/eva-petkova). 

I earned my M.S. in Biostatistics and Data Science from [Cornell University, Weill Cornell Medicine](https://gradschool.weill.cornell.edu/biostatistics-and-data-science), under the guidance of [Samprit Banerjee](https://gradschool.weill.cornell.edu/faculty/samprit-banerjee).
